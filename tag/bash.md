  Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell.
  Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features
  from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to
  conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools
  standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both
  programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can
  be run by Bash without modification.
