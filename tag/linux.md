  Linux is a family of free and open-source software operating systems
  built around the Linux kernel. Typically, Linux is packaged in
  a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both
  desktop and server use. The defining component of
  a Linux distribution is the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel
  first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
