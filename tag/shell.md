    In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating
    system's services. In general, operating system shells use either a
    command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI),
    depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named
    a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating
    system kernel.
