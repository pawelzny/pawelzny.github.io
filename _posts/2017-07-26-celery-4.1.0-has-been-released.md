New version of Celery has been released. With new release documentation has not been updated.
I have trouble to run celery-beat on this version. All workers works just fine, but beat
stop sending messages to workers.

Probably bug? Maybe some changes in scheduler?

I suggest to stay with 4.0.2 version and wait for at least docs update.
