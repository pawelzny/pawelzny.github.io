I am a tech leader focused on Python and chatbots.
On my blog I write about confusing or poorly documented features
of tools and libraries I use.

Every single post is an essence from what I have learn from
documentation, other blogs, source code and by mistakes I made.

If you find something useful,
leave a comment or say Hi on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Everything on this blog may be wrong or even dangerous.
I will be thrilled when you point any mistake so everybody
including me can learn.
